(ns biscuit.kotoba
  "A verified biscuit as the **delegated** term of Kotoba's effective scope.

  `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`'s `lang/capability-semantics.edn` already defines
  the shape of an answer:

      :effective-scope  :requested-intersect-delegated-intersect-local-policy
      :scope-attenuation-only  true
      :unknown-kind  :deny
      :missing-grant :deny

  Three of those four terms already have owners — `requested` is what the
  guarded call asks for, `local-policy` is the host's, and the rules are the
  language's. **`delegated` had no wire.** This namespace is that wire, and
  it is the concrete meaning of \"biscuit is the delegation centre\": not
  that biscuit replaces the semantics, but that it is what fills the one slot
  the semantics left open.

  ## It maps into `:grant/*`, not into `:cap/*`

  A capability (`:cap/kind`, `:cap/resource`, `:cap/holder`) is authority a
  handler receives *after* intersection. A grant (`:grant/kind`,
  `:grant/resources`, `:grant/expires`, `:grant/id`) is what a delegation
  confers *before* it. A token that produced capabilities directly would be a
  token that skipped the intersection — which is the one step the semantics
  says is not optional.

  ## Unknown kinds deny, and that is the interesting direction

  `:kinds` in the semantics is a **closed set**. A biscuit fact naming a kind
  outside it is not ignored (which would silently drop a restriction the
  issuer intended) and does not throw (a token from a newer fleet is an
  ordinary event). It lands in `:grant/rejected`, and a rejected kind confers
  nothing — so the failure is toward less authority, and it is visible."

            [authority.grant :as grant]
            [authority.scope :as scope]

            [kotoba.lang.text :as str]))

(defn- narrow
  "The resources both blocks confer — scopes met in the lattice, opaque names
  intersected.

  ## Why this is not `set/intersection`

  It was, and that made the ordinary act of attenuating a wildcard produce a
  token reaching nothing:

      block 0   cap graph-read kotoba://graph/*
      block 1   cap graph-read kotoba://graph/g1

  Those two strings intersect to the EMPTY SET, so narrowing a namespace
  grant down to one member — the operation Biscuit is chosen for — silently
  destroyed the grant instead of narrowing it. Measured 2026-08-31 by a
  consumer (`network-awai/app-hyakka`), which had to fold per block against
  `authority.chain` to get a correct answer out of this namespace.

  `biscuit.authority/->grant`, ten lines away in this same library, has
  always folded with `authority.grant/meet`. So the library held **two**
  answers to *what do two blocks jointly confer* and only one of them was
  the lattice. That is exactly what `authority` exists to prevent, and its
  own docstring here says adding biscuits must add no new answer to *does
  this cover that*. This removes the second answer rather than adding a
  third.

  ## Why string identity survives for the rest

  `:cap/resource` is not always a scope. `[cap \"infer\" \"murakumo-main\"]`
  names a model alias, and an opaque name has exactly one relation available
  to it — identity. Parsing partitions the set, so the two rules never apply
  to the same member: a resource the lattice can read is met, one it cannot
  is intersected, and one that parses on only ONE side relates to nothing
  and is therefore dropped. Every branch narrows; none can widen."

(defn ->delegated
  "Verified token + the semantics' `:kinds` set -> Kotoba grants.

  -> `{:grants [{:grant/kind :grant/resources :grant/expires :grant/id} …]
       :grant/rejected [...]}`

  Facts read: `[cap <kind> <resource>]` and `[before <instant>]`. Everything
  else stays available to checks and policies and confers nothing — the same
  one-directional ignorance `biscuit.authority` documents, for the same
  reason: **an unread fact cannot widen a grant.**

  Blocks fold in order and later blocks may only narrow — never add a kind,
  never widen a resource. `:scope-attenuation-only true` is not a convention
  this honours, it is the only thing this function can express.

  **Narrowing is `authority`'s, not string identity's** (see `narrow`). A
  later block naming `kotoba://graph/g1` under `kotoba://graph/*` yields
  `kotoba://graph/g1`, which is what attenuating a namespace grant is FOR;
  until 2026-08-31 those two strings intersected to nothing and the ordinary
  act of narrowing destroyed the grant instead."

  This is the whole `does this token reach that resource` question, in one

  metered wiki walk and `net-kotobase` was about to need the same thing for
  its paid graph reads, and a second copy of a covering decision is exactly
  what `kotoba-lang/authority` exists to prevent.

  `:verified?` is REQUIRED and is not defaulted. `biscuit.wire/token->model`
  hands back a model whether or not a signature was checked, and its own
  docstring says a caller that converts without verifying has decoded an
  attacker's facts. Refusing here rather than trusting every caller to
  remember means a deployment with no root key configured answers
  `:pass/unverified` — a value that is neither a grant nor an ordinary
  denial, so `could not check` and `checked and denied` cannot print the
  same (superproject ADR-2608136000).

  The holder is deliberately NOT passed to `authority.chain`. Nothing in a
  bearer presentation proves the presenter is the principal a `holder` fact
  names, and a holder check against an unauthenticated presenter would
  report `:wrong-holder` for a mismatch while reporting `:granted` for a
