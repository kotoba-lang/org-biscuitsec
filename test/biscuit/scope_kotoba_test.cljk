;; `kotoba/biscuit/scope.kotoba` -- the delegated-scope intersection.
;;
;; The token is built with the library's own `biscuit.token/authority` and
;; `append`, signed with the test keypairs, and verified with the real
;; chain, so nothing here is a hand-written token shape. The guest is then
;; driven from the SAME verified blocks the library reads.
;;
;; ## Parity
;;
;; `the-guest-agrees-with-authorize` walks the cases `biscuit.effective`
;; gets right: a grant that is conferred and survives attenuation, one
;; narrowed away by a later block, an unknown kind, a token that delegates
;; nothing, and a local policy that does not allow the resource.
;;
;; ## Three findings, each executed rather than described
;;
;;   * `a-later-block-can-introduce-a-kind` -- `->delegated`'s fold is
;;     `(if (empty? acc) block ...)`, and `acc` is empty when the AUTHORITY
;;     block declared no `cap` facts. Appending a block is what every holder
;;     of a biscuit may do offline with no key at all, so this is a widening
;;     any holder can perform. Its own docstring says "It can never
;;     introduce a kind".
;;
;;   * `the-capabilitys-holder-comes-from-the-caller` -- `->delegated`
;;     computes `:grant/holder` from the authority block and `authorize`
;;     never reads it, stamping `:cap/holder (:cap/holder requested)` on the
;;     capability it returns. `:cap/holder` is one of the semantics'
;;     `:identity-keys`.
;;
;;   * `expiry-is-compared-lexicographically` -- `authorize` orders instants
;;     with `compare`, which on strings is byte order. Two spellings of the
;;     same instant with different offsets order wrongly, so a token that
;;     expired can be live and one that is live can be expired. The guest
;;     does NOT fix this: it takes `:expired?` already decided, because
;;     fixing it needs an instant parser and that is a different slice. The
;;     test shows the defect where it is.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the fold it gets right and is not required
;; from the guest (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy
;; (ADR-2608261100).
