  "What each root-key distribution costs, computed rather than asserted.

  The unit is **fetches per verification**, because on an edge a fetch is a
  round trip and everything else is noise beside it. The parameters are
  stated so the answer can be recomputed with different ones rather than
  believed.

  The decisive column is not cost at all — it is what a compromise of the
  distribution point buys an attacker — but that column is a property, not a
  number, so it is printed beside the arithmetic rather than folded into it."
