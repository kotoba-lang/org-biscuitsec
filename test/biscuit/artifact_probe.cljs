;; Compile `kotoba/biscuit/scope.kotoba` and run the COMPILED artifact.
;;
;; The JVM suite drives the guest through the KIR interpreter, which is not
;; the thing that ships. This runs the `.wasm` the public CLI produces, on
;; real `WebAssembly`, through amu's own `runtime/browser-host.mjs`, and
;; prints what it answered so `scope_artifact_test.clj` can hold it against
;; the interpreter.
;;
;; nbb rather than a `.mjs`: this workspace does not add raw JavaScript
;; harnesses (CLAUDE.md, runtime priority).
;;
;; This guest is a STREAM -- `init` then a fact at a time then `end-block`,
;; each returning the next state -- so the probe passes the guest's own
;; returned document straight back in. That works because the value is
;; already trusted by the runtime; a document the host wants to INTRODUCE
;; has to go through `typedValues.document` in the tagged form the KIR value
;; plane uses, and building one any other way is refused as forged. Both
;; directions are exercised here.
;;
;; A whole walk shares ONE instance on purpose: the state has to survive
;; across the calls. That is the one place the per-call-instance rule does
;; not apply, and it is why the tokens here are small -- a module's fuel is
;; a private global baked in at compile time (512 by default) and is spent
;; over the life of an instance.
