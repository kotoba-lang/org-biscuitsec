  "Kotoba's five-origin authorization join.

  Amu proves static possibility, the VM supplies one concrete intent,
  Biscuit supplies only an attenuated grant, local policy supplies permission,
  and the runtime supplies current availability. Only their bounded Datalog
  join can produce a concrete capability. Token facts are deliberately hidden
  from policy saturation; only the verified `grant:` projection enters it."
